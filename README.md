## 1. Web scraping part:

### Price comparison:
Our bot will extract data 
And give top 5 products on the basis of relevance,offer and popularity from both snapdeal and Flipkart.
And show them in tabular format with their link , in clear and concise manner.
Links could be replaced with afiliate links to generate revenue.

#### Input
![Price 1](https://github.com/devagnair/FreeCom/blob/main/freecom%20ss/price%201.jpg)

#### Output
![Price 2](https://github.com/devagnair/FreeCom/blob/main/freecom%20ss/price%202.jpg)

### Product comparison:
In this we can compare two products i.e either mobile or laptop.
Why only mobile and laptop?
Because these two categories have most amount of specifications i.e fingerprint sensor, processor,RAM etc.Also it needs clear and concise analysis of specifications.

#### Input
![Product 1](https://github.com/devagnair/FreeCom/blob/main/freecom%20ss/product%201.jpg)

#### Output
![Product 2](https://github.com/devagnair/FreeCom/blob/main/freecom%20ss/product%202.jpg)

## 2.QR code Reader and scanner with the help of OpenCv.

We can use this to distinguish authentic products.
Eg. Reebok , Nike, iPhone etc all gives qr and barcode reader for checking the authenticity.
